====================

This repository is a fork of [herdtools](https://github.com/herd/herdtools7) providing the additional tool `cat2coq` which transforms memory models in the herd format (.cat) into memory model formalised in Coq. It is supposed to be used in conjunction with [cats](https://github.com/jmadiot/cats), a library to reason about memory models in coq.
